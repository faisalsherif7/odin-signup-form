# Sign-up Form

## Project Overview
A sign-up form for an imaginary service, designed to practice HTML form elements, CSS styling, and basic JavaScript validation. It involved creating a responsive form with various input styles, background images, and form validation using pseudo-classes like `:invalid` and `:focus`.

## Skills Practiced
- HTML form structure
- CSS for input styling, buttons, and backgrounds
- Pseudo-classes (`:invalid`, `:focus`) for interactive form elements
- Basic JavaScript for form validation
- External assets (background images, fonts)

**Note**: Mobile responsiveness isn't covered in this project.
